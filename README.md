# Recipes-Connected | Taste the World at Home
Recipes-Connected is a website for foodies. Users can learn how to cook different recipes from all over the world. Each user can add, edit, and delete their recipes by creating a registration and logging into their profile. Each recipe contains an ingredient list, cooking instructions and an image of the dish. The goal of the website is to have users share and/or learn recipes from all over the world. The website should give the user an ‘learning’ experience.

## UX
To understand what the end result of the website needs to be, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analysing and breaking down the problem into five planes:

### Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the developer’s objective and the user needs (goals).

#### User Stories
As a **user** I want to:
1.  Learn new recipes
2.	Contact the recipe owner
3.	Add my own recipes
4.	Edit my recipes
5.	Delete my recipes
6.	Register my profile
7.	Login to my profile

As a **developer** I want to:
1.  Gain more knowledge on Python, MongoDB and Flask
2.  Learn more on databases, in particular MongoDB
3.  Add and share my own personal favorite recipes on the website

### Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include on the website.
This will be further explained in the next chapter. A summary of the included and not included features are:

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|
| :------------- | :---------- |
|1. Navigation menu | 1. Contact form to contact the owner of the recipe|
|2. Hero image with link to add recipes | 2. Rearranging the recipes by name|
|3. Landing page with category recipes| 3. Rating a recipe
|4. Add recipe page | 4. Adding a comment to a recipe
|5. Edit recipe page |
|6. Registration page |
|7. Login page |
|8. User's profile page |

### Structure Plane

The structure plane defines the information architecture and interaction design with the user. The following definitions has been used for this website:

- First impression of the website needs to be simple and clear as possible
- No more than three clicks are required for the user to reach the page
- The type of information architecture that will be used is the ‘Hierarchical Tree’, see below:

### Skeleton Plane
The skeleton plane defines a basic visual design of the website through, for example, a wireframe.  
The wireframes for this project are made with Balsamiq can be downloaded from the following link:

- [Wireframe - Desktop version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/recipes-connected/raw/master/static/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Desktop.pdf)
- [Wireframe - Tablet version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/recipes-connected/raw/master/static/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Tablet.pdf)
- [Wireframe - Mobile version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/recipes-connected/raw/master/static/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Mobile.pdf)

Below you can find an example of a wireframe of the landing page.

### Surface Plane
The surface plane defines the appearance of the website. This website needs to attract and encourage users to focus on the website's content.
The following design style has been used:

| Design Style | Design Choice|
| :------------- | :---------- |
Font: Playfair Display | A clear font to give the website a personal look|
Text colour: #152a23 | A dark green color|
Background colour: #fff7| To enhance the recipe images |
Contrast ratio: 9.26 | A high ratio to express the visibility of the text (source: contrast-ratio.com)|
