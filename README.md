Each user can add, edit, and delete their recipes by creating a registration and logging into their profile. Each recipe contains an ingredient list, cooking instructions and an image of the dish. The goal of the website is to have users share and/or learn recipes from all over the world. The website should give the user an ‘learning’ experience.

## UX
To understand what the end result of the website needs to be, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analysing and breaking down the problem into five planes:

### Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the developer’s objective and the user needs (goals).

#### User Stories
As a **user** I want to:
1.  Learn new recipes
2.	Contact the recipe owner
3.	Add my own recipes
4.	Edit my recipes
5.	Delete my recipes
6.	Register my profile
7.	Login to my profile

As a **developer** I want to:
1.  Gain more knowledge on Python, MongoDB and Flask
2.  Learn more on databases, in particular MongoDB
3.  Add and share my own personal favorite recipes on the website
